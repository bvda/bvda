### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brian and I solve and create problems with computers.

I'm employed as an IT-specialist at The Independent Evidence Oversight Board.

I was born the year the i386 became widely available and got my first computer at the age of 8. It was an Amiga 500. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking at how DNA evidence is handled by the police and the Prosecution Service in Denmark and assisting The Danish Police Complaints Authority with all things digital.
