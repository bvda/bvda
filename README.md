### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brian and I solve and create problems with computers.

I'm currently employed as an IT-specialist at The Independent Evidence Oversight Board.

Throughout my career I've worked a wide range of technologies in the private and academic sector.

I was born the year the i386 became widely available and got my first computer at the age of 8. It was an Amiga 500.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking at how technical evidence is handled by the Danish police and prosecution service. I'm also assisting The Danish Police Complaints Authority with all things digital.
